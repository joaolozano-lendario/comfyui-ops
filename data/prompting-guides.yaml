  characteristics:
    - "Keyword-based prompting (tags separated by commas)"
    - "Quality boosters essential"
    - "Negative prompts critical"
    - "Supports prompt weights: (word:1.2) or ((word))"
    - "Order matters: early tokens weighted more"

  optimal_settings:
    resolution: "512x512"
    cfg_scale: "7-8"
    steps: "20-30"
    sampler: "DPM++ 2M Karras"
    scheduler: "karras"

  example_positive_prompt: |
    masterpiece, best quality, highly detailed, professional photography,
    portrait of a woman in business attire, modern office background,
    natural lighting, sharp focus, 8k uhd, dslr, soft lighting, high quality

  example_negative_prompt: |
    lowres, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit,
    fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, jpeg artifacts,

    - "Not including quality boosters"
    - "Using resolutions above 512x512 without upscaling"
    - "Forgetting to specify lighting and quality"

  tips:
    - "Front-load most important keywords"
    - "Use parentheses for emphasis: (keyword:1.2)"
    - "Combine multiple quality tags"
    - "Always specify medium (photo, painting, 3d render, etc.)"

    wearing an impeccably tailored charcoal gray suit. She stands confidently
    in a corner office with panoramic city views visible through floor-to-ceiling
    windows behind her. The lighting is sophisticated three-point studio lighting
    with a key light from the left creating subtle shadows that define her features,
    fill light from the right, and rim lighting from behind separating her from
    the background. Shot with a medium format Hasselblad camera using an 80mm lens
    at f/2.8 for shallow depth of field, keeping her face razor sharp while the
    city background dissolves into elegant bokeh. Color graded with rich, deep tones
    and slightly desaturated for a modern corporate aesthetic.

    steps: "20-50"
    sampler: "dpmpp_2m"
    scheduler: "sgm_uniform"

  example_positive_prompt: |
    A striking corporate portrait photograph of a Chinese-American businesswoman,
    approximately 35 years old, photographed in a contemporary Shanghai office
    tower. She wears a tailored navy pinstripe suit with a crisp white shirt,
    exuding confidence and professionalism. The composition places her slightly
    off-center, following the golden ratio, with the iconic Shanghai skyline
    visible through floor-to-ceiling windows in the background, slightly out of
    focus. The time is late afternoon, golden hour, with warm sunlight streaming
    through the windows creating a rim light effect that outlines her silhouette.
    A subtle fill light from the left prevents harsh shadows. Her expression is
    calm and focused, eyes looking slightly above the camera, suggesting vision
    and forward-thinking leadership. The color palette is sophisticated: deep
    blues, warm golds, and cool grays. Shot on a full-frame camera with an 85mm
    portrait lens at f/1.8 for beautiful bokeh. The overall aesthetic should feel
    like a Bloomberg Businessweek cover - polished, aspirational, globally minded.

    - "Setting CFG too low (can be higher than Flux)"
    - "Not specifying cultural context when relevant"

  tips:
    - "Excellent for cross-cultural content"
    - "Can mix English and Chinese in prompts"
    - "Handles very long, detailed descriptions (1000+ chars)"
    - "Strong at architectural and environmental context"
    - "Negative prompts can help refine quality"
    - "CFG range is wider (4-7) compared to other modern models"
    - "Good at specific artistic styles and aesthetics"
